# Pipeline-MIPS-Processor

implementation for a subset of the pipelined MIPS architecture in HDL.
A functioning outline of the pipelined processor for a small set of instructions,
including: decoding all the instructions,
implementing most of the MIPS pipeline,
correct implementation of arithmetic and logic operations,
and implementing a hazard detection and avoidance unit for these instructions.
